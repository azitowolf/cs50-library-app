# CS50 Library Project
This project is meant to give me a foundation to learn the basics of dotnet development as well as Azure Devops.

It's live on azure = https://codementor-library-app.azurewebsites.net/

It focuses on a couple big topics, listed below:

## Dotnet Core 6
1. N-tier architecture
2. Database access + Entity framework
3. MVC + CSharp Views
4. Unit testing 

## Azure
1. SQL DB
2. App service
3. Application insights
